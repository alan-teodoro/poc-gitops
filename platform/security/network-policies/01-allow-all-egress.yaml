# SIMPLIFIED: Allow All Egress Network Policy
# Purpose: Allow all pods to communicate outbound (DNS, K8s API, inter-pod, external)
# Strategy: Simplified approach - Redis Enterprise needs complex communication patterns
# Security: Still provides value by allowing ingress restrictions in other policies
